# Note

These files are the content that the bot would have output if there were no Bulgarian entries on all of the pages it attempted to 'edit'.
(Reminder: this is just a text preview, no actual changes have been committed yet.)
You may notice that each entry therefore may have two `==Bulgarian==` headers. This is perhaps intended, as it helps to show what the bot does
in terms of positioning its additions within the page. If you spot any errors at all, please feed them back to me here, on Wiktionary, or at fr13drice69420@gmail.com.
Thank you for reading :)
