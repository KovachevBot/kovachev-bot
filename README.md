# kovachev-bot

The source code for my Wiktionary bot, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:KovachevBot. The purpose of the bot is to automatically generate Bulgarian derived form entries from nouns' declension tables. 
You can peer into my abominable coding practices if you wish, and can verify that I won't try to obliterate the entire platform without compunction... I'd also like to apologise for naming the bot after myself, but the Wiktionary policy made me do it :x

Please see the bot's user page if you need more specifics as to the purpose and function of the bot.
